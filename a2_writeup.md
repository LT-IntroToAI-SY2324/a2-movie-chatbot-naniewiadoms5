# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?

Completing the match function was very difficult for me because of parsing through the statement to find where the underscore is or the percent sign is and then checking if the all the tests pass by making sure the pattern matches the source. It was also hard when one reached the end and other was still trying to match non-existing indices.

2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.

We could use this function for extracting information from a movie database to quickly and efficiently fetch details about the movie. This could be useful when a user wants to search for a specific movie by their favorite director or actors. I figure algorithms like these (but more advanced) are used in movie sites like Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, etc.
